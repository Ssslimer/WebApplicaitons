- Task4: Simple shop/service provider server with booking, it can be used manually and had to berified with some simulation
- Task5: Simulation of deadlock, livelock and starvation
- Task6: Server providing optimization services. One can pass an equation to it and extrema will be found using differential evolution and simulated annealing.
Client program provides also a graphical interface to display a function and how extrema were found.
